# LEDarcade: A Custom Retro LED Game Engine

> **Created by William McEvoy (aka Datagod)**  
> *An old-school arcade engineer reborn in modern code, driven by imagination and forged in self-reliance.*

---

## ðŸŽ® Overview
LEDarcade is a powerful and deeply customized Python engine for rendering retro-style graphics and games on an RGB LED matrix attached to a Raspberry Pi.

Unlike most projects, LEDarcade was created entirely from scratch â€” without relying on internet tutorials, prefab game engines, or outside design templates. Everything from gamma-corrected color blending to real-time physics and sprite animation was hand-coded, tested, and refined by one mind.

---

## ðŸ§± Core Features

- **Pixel-Accurate Rendering** with direct-to-buffer control
- **Dual-Buffer Architecture**: Clean separation between the display (`TheMatrix`) and working state (`ScreenArray`)
- **Extensive Color System**:
  - Dozens of hand-tuned colors with gamma control
  - Shadow/Highlight/Glow overlays
- **Real-Time Game Engine Modules**:
  - SuperWorms
  - Dot Invaders
  - Outbreak
  - Defender
- **Sprite Frameworks**:
  - `Dot`, `Ship`, `Sprite`, `Wall`, `ColorAnimatedSprite`
  - Support for zooming, flipping, scrolling, and trail effects
- **Integrated Flask/Asyncio Services**:
  - Twitch EventSub listening (Port 5051)
  - Patreon status monitoring (Port 5050)
- **Configuration Loader** (`ClockConfig.ini`) for display tuning and score persistence

---

## ðŸš€ What Makes It Unique
- Built without copying â€” all systems invented or reverse-engineered from foundational knowledge
- A living homage to the classic hardware sprite engines of the 1980s
- Visual logic grounded in **how light behaves**, not just RGB codes
- A toolkit for creating both **games and animated art** on LED panels

---

## ðŸ”§ Requirements
- Raspberry Pi (any model with GPIO and Python 3)
- RGB Matrix HAT and compatible LED panel (e.g., 32x64)
- `rpi-rgb-led-matrix` Python bindings
- `PIL`, `curses`, `requests`, `asyncio`, and optional Flask for web hooks

---

## ðŸ§  Philosophy
LEDarcade was designed with one question in mind:
> *"What could I create if I relied only on my own mind â€” no forums, no templates, no training wheels?"*

The result is a living artifact of technical mastery, built for joy, exploration, and pure expression.

---

## ðŸ‘¾ Future Directions
- Sprite animation editor
- On-device sprite debugger
- Wi-Fi synced multiplayer

---

## ðŸ™Œ Acknowledgements
This project was envisioned, built, and perfected by William McEvoy (Datagod) â€” programmer, arcade historian, and lifelong creator.  His son Jacob McEvoy designed several levels and performed quality assurance on many aspects of the project.

## Background
Arcade Retro Clock started out as a project on an 8x8 matrix.  Over the years it has been converted to 16x16 and now 64x32.  Each conversion process involved solving many bugs and enhancing the game play especially with respects to the computer's ability to play against itself.

For LEDarcade, I decided to isolate classes, functions, sprites, etc. that are used specifically for displaying messages and animations and to exclude any functions used to control the specific games.

## What it can do
LEDArcade has many classes, functions, pre-defined sprites that are used to do the following:

- draw a sprite
- move a sprite
- make a sprite float across the screen
- raw animated sprites floating across the screen
- draw text of multiple sizes
- scroll text left or right at various speeds
- multiple ways to clear the screen (zooming in / zooming out / fading)
- scroll the screen around a large map, displaying only a section of the map in a window

There are many more functions available but they are fairly complex. As this project moves forward I will create more examples and document each function.

 ## Retro Arcade Games
 I have programmed 9 games on several sizes of LED matrixes using this library (in various forms).  As I convert the games to this final library I'll add them here.
 
 # Dot Invaders
 Dot Invaders is my take on the classic arcade game Space Invaders.
