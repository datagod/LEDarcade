  <summary>monospaced font based on IBM 3270 terminals</summary>

    <p>
       This font is derived from the x3270 font, which, in turn, was translated
 from the one in Georgia Tech's 3270tool, which was itself hand-copied
 from a 3270 terminal.
 .
 While looking reasonably close to its bitmap ancestors, this is a vector
 font that looks good at any size.  Its recommended use is, obviously, a
 text terminal, same as nearly half a century ago.
